# Nasa Space Apps 2023 - 7 October 2023

### Challenge:
Imagine an Earth-orbiting satellite, or an Earth-to-Moon mission that requires an orbital transfer maneuver, or a spacecraft in a cyclical orbit around Earth and Mars, or a deep space probe that traverses the asteroid belt. Understanding and visualizing sophisticated space missions isnâ€™t easy! Your challenge is to create an interactive, virtual reality application that enables users to visualize a space mission including the mission concept, orbital trajectories, and mission timeline.
